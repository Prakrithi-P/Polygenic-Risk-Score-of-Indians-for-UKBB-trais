# Polygenic-Risk-Score-of-Indians-for-UKBB-trais

Calculate the genetic predesposition for GWAS traits for the different ancestral Indian sub-populations by computing polygenic risk scores based on available association studies. This code works for summary statistics of the UK BioBank. The header fields (SNP/Chr/Position columns) can be modified based on any other consortia you use from the GWAS catalog.
